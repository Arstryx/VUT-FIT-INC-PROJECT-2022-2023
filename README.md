# VUT-FIT-INC-PROJECT-2022-2023
Here is my version of this project.
Evaluation: 15/20.
Software used:
GHDL + GTKWave (on WSL) for simulation (I`d also recommend you to try ModelSim as a more powerful simulator);
Lucidchart for circuit drawing;
VS code with .vhdl extensions;
Microsoft Word for creating the report.
Copy any part on your own risk.
